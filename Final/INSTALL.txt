If Google Chrome or Firefox is set as your default browser, simply double click the "Index.html", to open the webpage.
If Internet Explorer is currently set as your default browser, right-click "Index.html" and go to "Open with", then select either Google Chrome or Firefox.

For correct viewing, the minimum screen resolution, of the computer monitor, must be at least 1024x768 or greater. 
For optimal viewing, It is recommended that the computer screen resolution be set to at least 1280x800 or greater.
On computers running Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, the screen resolution can be changed by right clicking on a blank area of your desktop, and going to "Screen Resolution".

If the screen resolution is smaller than 1024x768 and cannot be changed, an alternative option is to "zoom out" the webpage.
This can be done by selecting your browser and pressing "Ctrl" and "-" on your keyboard. 
Pressing "Ctrl" and "+" will "zoom in" and "Ctrl" and "0" (zero)  will reset the zoom level.
