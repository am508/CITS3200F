								Diabetes is a chronic condition characterised by high levels of glucose in the blood. These high levels are caused by the pancreas being unable to produce enough insulin, by the body becoming resistant to insulin, or by a combination of the two. Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas which is released into the blood stream and helps move glucose from the food we eat to our cells for energy.
								<br><br>
								The cause of diabetes is not fully understood. Though there are known genetic markers, there are possibly a number of factors that trigger the onset of diabetes. Possible triggers include viral infections or similar stresses to the body, which cause the body's "fighting cells" (white blood cells) to attack the beta cells, mistaking them for foreign or harmful cells. Only the beta cells are affected in this very slow process that may take up to eight or nine years. Signs and symptoms of diabetes do not present until about ninety percent of beta calls have been destroyed.

			+"</audio> <br></br>Your heart is really a muscle. It’s located a little to the left of the middle of your "
			+"chest, and it’s about the size of your fist. There are lots of muscles all over your body – in your "
			+"arms, in your legs, in your back, even in your bottom. The heart muscle is special because of what it "
			+"does. The heart sends blood around your body. The blood provides your body with the oxygen and nutrients "
			+"it needs. It also carries away waste and sends this to the kidneys. Most kids are born with a healthy "
			+"heart and it’s important to keep yours in good shape. <br></br>Living with type 1 diabetes can sometimes affect "
			+"your heart as having high blood glucose levels for a long time can cause the risk of narrowing blood "
			+"vessels that are important in moving blood around the body to become a lot higher. This can lower the "
			+"blood flow to the heart and brain. With narrower blood vessels and higher blood glucose levels that make "
			+"the blood sticky, the risk of blockage increases and you can be put at a risk of heart disease and stroke. "
			+"These effects can be reduced by following your diabetes management plan as recommended by your diabetes team. "
			+"Discuss with your diabetes team for any further concerns."

			+"Your kidneys are two of the most important organs in your body. They filter your blood and help "
			+"get rid of waste products from your body. Each kidney is about the size of a mobile phone. They "
			+"have an unusual shape – kidney beans are named after them because they have the same shape. Inside "
			+"each kidney there are about a million nephrons. They are tiny filters catching all the stuff that "
			+"your body doesn’t need and is sending out as waste. The kidneys do several important jobs which help "
			+"to keep your body working well. <ul><br><li>1. They get rid of waste products carried in the blood. The "
			+"kidneys are part of the waste disposal team. They check out the minerals, vitamins and other nutrients "
			+"that you get from your food and send off into urine anything that is not needed. They make urine, send "
			+"it down to the bladder through tubes called the ureters, and when the bladder feels full enough, the "
			+"brain sends you off to the toilet to get rid of the urine. </li><br> <li>2. They balance the volume of fluid "
			+"in the body. Adults have around 7-8 litres of fluid in the body, children have slightly less depending "
			+"on their size. All of this gets filtered through the kidneys many times a day. If the volume of fluid in "
			+"your body goes down (maybe you are sweating out a lot of fluid through your skin or maybe you are not "
			+"drinking enough water), the kidneys will not make much urine until the amount of fluid in your body goes "
			+"up.</li><br><li>3. They can change blood pressure. The kidneys make a hormone that can constrict (make "
			+"narrower) the arteries in the body. This causes blood pressure to rise when a higher pressure is needed "
			+"to make sure that blood gets to all parts of your body. </li><br><li> 4. They help in making red blood cells. "
			+"The kidneys make a hormone that tells the body when to make more red blood cells. </li><br> <li>5. They produce "
			+"vitamin D. This vitamin helps the body to absorb calcium from dairy products and some other foods that you "
			+"eat. Calcium is needed to make strong bones and teeth. </li></ul>High Blood Glucose Levels (BGL’s) place extra pressure "
			+"on the filters which can cause them to leak reusable nutrients (things that the body need to function) like "
			+"protein. This can affect the kidney functions in a bad way and may even lead to kidneys not working properly, "
			+"if at all. Your diabetes specialist will order urine tests to see if your kidneys are working properly as part "
			+"of your diabetes screening tests. Don’t forget to ask for the results during your clinic visit and discuss "
			+"further concerns with your diabetes health care professional."],

            +"You might wonder about nerves, which you can’t see without a microscope. What are they anyway? The nervous "
			+"system is made up of millions and millions of neurons which are microscopic cells. Each neuron has tiny "
			+"branches coming off it that let it connect to many other neurons. When you were born, your brain came with "
			+"all the neurons it will ever have, but many of them were not connected to each other. When you learn things, "
			+"the messages travel from one neuron to another, over and over. Eventually, the brain starts to create connection "

			+"numbness, a burning sensation and/or pain. But! This is the bad news! The good news is that it doesn’t have to be "

            +"Sight, more than any of our senses, helps us navigate the world around us. In a single glance, "
			+"lasting a fraction of a second, our eyes work with our brains to tell us the size, shape, colour, "
			+"and texture of an object. They let us know how close it is, whether it’s standing still or coming "
			+"toward us, and how quickly it’s moving. <br></br> The eyes are small compared with most organs, "
			+"but their structure is incredibly complex. They work together to perceive depth, enabling us to "
			+"judge distance and the size of objects to help us move around them. They also work with the brain, "
			+"muscles, and nerves to produce complicated visual images and messages. They also constantly adapt "
			+"to the changing environment – for example, adjusting so that we can easily move around in a nearly "
			+"dark room or bright sunlight. <br></br>To understand how the eyes work, it’s important to know about "
			+"their structure and about conditions and diseases that can interfere with vision. <br></br> Light passes through "
			+"the cornea and the pupil and then passes through the lens, helping to focus the light onto the retina, "
			+"which is located at the back of the eye. The cells in the retina detect the light and form a focused "
			+"image which is then sent to the brain by the optic nerve. The macula is a small, specialised area on the "
			+"retina that helps the eyes see fine details when we look directly at an object. High blood glucose levels "
			+"can cause damage to the blood vessels of the retina which can then affect vision. A review with the eye "
			+"specialist every two years is important to get your eyes checked for any problems. Ask for the results of"

								<p align="left">Healthy eating and a well balanced diet is essential for optimal diabetes control. When planning meals, include foods from each of the following groups.<br>
								<br>
								Energy "Go" foods - bread, cereals, rice, pasta and noodles<br>
								Protective "Glow" foods - vegetables and fruit<br>
								Body building "Grow" foods - milk, yoghurt, cheese, meat, chicken and eggs<br>
								<br>
								The majority of foods you consume will increase blood glucose levels. This is because they contain carbohydrates, which provide energy and are essential for growth and development. To manage the rise in blood glucose levels, the pre-meal insulin dose needs to match the quantity of carbohydrates you are eating at each meal.<br>
								<br>
								Some carbohydrate containing foods such as lollies and sweet drinks will cause blood glucose levels to rise rapidly and should not be eaten frequently.</p>

								<p align="left">Scheduled doses of Insulin helps to lower glucose levels. There are two types of insulin, a fast acting insulin that is normally taken around meal times, and a slow acting insulin generally taken before bed. Take your insulin as suggested by your doctor or diabetes educator. Dosage differs from person to person and can depend on your diet.

This is due to your body converting glucose to energy. The longer or more intense the exercise is, the greater the effect it has on lowering glucose levels in the body.

								<br>
								<p align="left">Keeping a regular schedule of all of the above, and sticking to it, is important to keeping blood glucose levels under control. This includes keeping track of levels throughout the day, as well as monitoring stress, foods eaten and exercise times.
Planning ahead is also crucial, as unexpected hypoglycaemic events can occur. Small amounts of sweets or sweet drinks can be eaten if the body’s blood glucose level drops unexpectedly low. Alternatively, glucose tablets can be taken. Keeping your hypoglycaemic pack with you during exercise sessions or when going about daily activities helps to account for situations where blood glucose levels need to be quickly brought back up to normal levels.
