								Diabetes is a chronic condition characterised by high levels of glucose in the blood. These high levels are caused by the pancreas being unable to produce enough insulin, by the body becoming resistant to insulin, or by a combination of the two. Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas which is released into the blood stream and helps move glucose from the food we eat to our cells for energy.
								<br><br>
								The cause of diabetes is not fully understood. Though there are known genetic markers, there are possibly a number of factors that trigger the onset of diabetes. Possible triggers include viral infections or similar stresses to the body, which cause the body's "fighting cells" (white blood cells) to attack the beta cells, mistaking them for foreign or harmful cells. Only the beta cells are affected in this very slow process that may take up to eight or nine years. Signs and symptoms of diabetes do not present until about ninety percent of beta calls have been destroyed.

								<p align="left">Healthy eating and a well balanced diet is essential for optimal diabetes control. When planning meals, include foods from each of the following groups.<br>
								<br>
								Energy "Go" foods - bread, cereals, rice, pasta and noodles<br>
								Protective "Glow" foods - vegetables and fruit<br>
								Body building "Grow" foods - milk, yoghurt, cheese, meat, chicken and eggs<br>
								<br>
								The majority of foods you consume will increase blood glucose levels. This is because they contain carbohydrates, which provide energy and are essential for growth and development. To manage the rise in blood glucose levels, the pre-meal insulin dose needs to match the quantity of carbohydrates you are eating at each meal.<br>
								<br>
								Some carbohydrate containing foods such as lollies and sweet drinks will cause blood glucose levels to rise rapidly and should not be eaten frequently.</p>

								<p align="left">Scheduled doses of Insulin helps to lower glucose levels. There are two types of insulin, a fast acting insulin that is normally taken around meal times, and a slow acting insulin generally taken before bed. Take your insulin as suggested by your doctor or diabetes educator. Dosage differs from person to person and can depend on your diet.

This is due to your body converting glucose to energy. The longer or more intense the exercise is, the greater the effect it has on lowering glucose levels in the body.

								<p align="left">Keeping a regular schedule of all of the above, and sticking to it, is important to keeping blood glucose levels under control. This includes keeping track of levels throughout the day, as well as monitoring stress, foods eaten and exercise times.
Planning ahead is also crucial, as unexpected hypoglycaemic events can occur. Small amounts of sweets or sweet drinks can be eaten if the body’s blood glucose level drops unexpectedly low. Alternatively, glucose tablets can be taken. Keeping your hypoglycaemic pack with you during exercise sessions or when going about daily activities helps to account for situations where blood glucose levels need to be quickly brought back up to normal levels.
