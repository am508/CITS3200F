	About
=================

The aim of this project was to create an interactive app that provided information on type I diabetes.
It was intended to be used by people of a young age.

The following people were involved in creating this project:

	Marcus Altmann
	Julia Cowper
	Lawrence Ferguson
	Andrew Moss
	John Shahin
	Quang Vu Tran

=================
	Folders
=================

This directory should contain the following folders:
	- Audio
	- css
	- fonts
	- images
	- js
	- sass
	- scripts

And the following file, which forms the webpage:
	- index.html

Included information files are:
	- Readme.txt
	- Install.txt
	- HTML report.docx
 
The interactive webpage relies on these folders in order to work. Deleting or moving any files within these folders will cause certain elements in the webpage not to load.
 
================
	Usage
================

The files and folders must be first extracted to an appropriate directory before opening the webpage.
If Google Chrome or Firefox is set as your default browser, simply double click the "Index.html", to open the webpage.
If Internet Explorer is currently set as your default browser, right-click "Index.html" and go to "Open with", then select either Google Chrome or Firefox.
