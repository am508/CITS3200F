For correct viewing, the screen resolution must be set to at least 1152x864 or greater. 
On Windows 7, this can be changed by right clicking on a blank area of your desktop, and going to "Screen Resolution".

If the screen resolution is smaller than this and cannot be changed, an alternative option is to "zoom out" the webpage.
This can be done by selecting your browser and pressing "Ctrl" and "-" on your keyboard. 
Pressing "Ctrl" and "+" will "zoom in" and "Ctrl" and "0" (zero)  will reset the zoom level.
