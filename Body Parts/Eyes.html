	<p>The retina is the part of the eye that sees. It is a layer of cells in the back of the 
	eye. When light enters the eye, the retina changes any light that reaches it into signals
	that are sent to the brain, which turns the signals into the images you see. Damage to the 
	blood vessels of the retina can affect vision.</p>
	
	<p>It is very important to look after your eyes. You can do this by getting regular 
	check-ups at least every two years. The early stages may not have any symptoms so getting 
	checked can help keep your eyes healthy. Maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol 
	levels are also important to protect your eyes.</p>
	
	<p>Symptoms of eye problems can include:
		<ul>
			<li>Blurred, patchy vision that can't be corrected with glasses</li>
			<li>Problems with balance, reading, watching TV or recognizing people</li>
			<li>Over-sensitivity to glare</li>
			<li>Difficulty seeing at night</li>
		</ul>
		If you notice any of these symptoms, make an appointment to see your doctor.
