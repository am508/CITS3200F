<section id="Kidneys">
	<p>The kidneys are a filtering system for the body. They help clean the blood by 
	removing waste products and passing them out in urine. High blood glucose levels place 
	extra pressure on the filters which can cause reusable nutrients like protein to leak.</p>
	
	<p>Having small amounts of protein in your urine is called microalbuminuria, while 
	haveing large amounts of protein in your urine is called macroalbuminuria. When kidney 
	disease is caught during microalbuminuria there are treatments that can keep it from 
	getting worse. If it is caught during macroalbuminuria, or if it is not caught at all, 
	then kidney disease will usually lead to end stage renal disease(ESRD). ESRD is a result 
	of the waste building up in the blood which makes the kidneys fail. Someone with ESRD 
	either needs to have a kidney transplant or have their blood filtered by a machine, which 
	is called dialysis.</p>
	
	<p>Kidney disease develops slowly and can happen to anyone, but people with diabetes 
	are more likely to be affected. In the early stages of kidney disease there may not be 
	any symptoms so regular testing and annual check-ups with your doctor are important.</p>
