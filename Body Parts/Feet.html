	<p>High blood glucose levels can cause damage to the walls of the small blood vessels 
	which that nourish the nerves, especially the ones in the legs. This can cause tingling, 
	numbness, a burning sensation and/or shooting pains. The numbness can make it difficult 
	to notice cuts and other injuries until they get much worse. The damage to the small 
	blood vessels can also make it harder for your body to heal and to fight infections.</p>
	
	<p>Blood vessel damage can also lead to poor circulation, which can cause changes to 
	your skin like dryness, peeling and cracking. Calluses can also form on the bottom of 
	your feet or other high pressure points.</p>
	
	<p>It is important to have annual check-ups with your doctor to avoid problems with 
	your feet and prevent other nerve damage.</p>
	
	<p>While these issues usually affect the feet and legs, they can also affect the 
	hands, arms and skin on the rest of your body.</p>
