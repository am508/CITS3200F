<section id="Heart">
	<p>Cardiovascular disease is when you have damage to your heart and blood vessels. 
	It includes heart attacks, heart failure, strokes and circulation problems. The 
	major blood vessels are called arteries and veins. The arteries carry blood away 
	from your heart which veins carry blood towards your heart. When cholesterol and 
	other materials attach themselves to the blood vessels they reduce the room for 
	blood to flow. High glucose levels can also reduce the room for blood to flow. 
	Damage to your blood vessels can also cause clots to form on the walls of the blood 
	vessels. If the clots break off, they are get stuck in narrow blood vessels and 
	cause a blockage. A blockage of an artery can cause the part of the body it 
	supplies to be deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Blood vessels can be damaged by 
	high blood glucose, high blood pressure, smoking or high levels of cholesterol.</p>
	
	<p>A heart attack can happen when the blood vessels to your heart are blocked, while 
	a stroke can happen when the blood vessels to your brain are blocked. After a heart 
	attack, your heart might not be able to pump as much blood which is known as heart 
	failure. People with diabetes have a higher risk of heart attack, heart failure and 
	stroke.</p>
	
	<p>Heart attack, heart failure and stroke each have different warning signs, which 
	can be different from person to person, but usually include:
		<ul>
			<li>Heart Attack

					<li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>

	<p>There are many steps you can take to prevent a heart attack or stroke. Eating 
	a healthy diet, being physically active and quitting smoking are important to 
	help lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is also important to take any 
	medication your doctor prescribes and to have your blood pressure checked at 
	least twice a year and have your cholesterol checked at least once a year.</p>
