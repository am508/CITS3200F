	<p><b>Nervous System</b></p>
	<p>Neuropathy is a long term complication which affects the nerves. Nerves carry 
	messages between the brain and the various parts of the body. Nerves also carry signals 
	which handle a lot of bodily functions that people aren't aware of. Neuropathy is when 
	high blood glucose levels damage the small blood vessels which go to the nerves. This 
	keeps essential nutrients from reaching the nerves which damages them.</p>
	
	<p>Neuropathy can affect the nerves that carry information to organs and glands which 
	control fuctions without you thinking about them. This can cause a loss of bladder control, 
	sweating and other issues. Neuropathy can also affect the nerves which control movement. 
	This can lead to weakness and loss of muscle in the affected areas.</p>
	
	<p>The best way to avoid neuropathy is to keep your blood glucose levels in your target 
	range and to have regular check-ups.</p>
